# StudentSinglyLinkedList
-> Implement a special singly linked list class named ‘StudentSinglyLinkedList’. The name of the 
nodes of this linked list should be ‘Student’. Each node will have two data values (Name and 
CGPA) and one pointer (next). Implement following functions in this class:

1. insert_student(self, new_name, new_CGPA): This will add a Student node to the last of 
the list.
2. show_last_student(self): This function will display the name and CGPA of the last 
student in the list.
3. sort_student(self): This function will print a sorted list based on the name of the 
students alphabetically.
4. calculate_avg_CGPA(self): This function will calculate the average CGPA of all the 
customers.

* Remember, this is a singly linked list. All the functions will have to be based on singly linked list. 
Also, you have to add comments before each function in your code. The comment section will 
explain the steps/process of the functions you have implemented.

# Hints:
• You have to add these students using ‘insert_student’ function.
• Output of ‘show_last_student ()’ will be=> Nafis, 3.85.
• Output of ‘sort_ student()’ will be=> Jamal, Karim, Nafis, Rahim.
• Output of ‘calculate_avg_CGPA()’ will be=> 3.575.
